# WindshieldWiperMechanism

This project attempts to simulate the windshield wiper mechanism with no quick return effect. We will introduce some new functionalities to detetmine the state of our wiper.
(e.g., adjustment provision to change/increase the wiped region,
determination of wiping speed and acceleration (or their variation) for a given motor speed
(constant), torque requirement on motor (neglecting dynamics) etc.).
